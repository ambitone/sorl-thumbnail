my-changes
    Various custom changes on top of the original upstream code.

    Rebases against the upstream trunk branch.

my-storage-refactor
    Custom attempt to support Django's storage backends. Could
    potentially be consolidated with the upstream storage-refactor
    branch if and when work is being done there.

    Rebases against the upstream trunk branch.

my-storage-refactor-changes
    Various custom changes on top of the storage refactor branch.
    These are changes that depend on updates made to that branch,
    but which do not necessarily relate to the intent of implementing
    storage support per se.

    Rebases against "my-storage-refactor".

podster3:
    Branch for the podster3 project that merges everything from
    both "my-changes" and "my-storage-refactor-changes" together.
